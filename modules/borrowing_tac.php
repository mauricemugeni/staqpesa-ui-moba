                                <p>Interest Rate - What you pay each year in interest, shown as a percentage of the total amount you borrowed.</p>

                                <p>Origination Fee - one-time loan processing fee of 1-4% that’s only charged when you receive your loan. It’s deducted from your loan when the 
                                    loan is issued, so you’ll receive the amount you applied for minus the origination fee.</p>

                                <p>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) - The total yearly cost of your loan, including both the interest rate and the origination fee. The APR is the 
                                    best way to quickly compare your yearly costs for different loan options.</p>

                                        of up-front application fee or other advance payment to obtain a loan. And, you can pay your loan off any time with no prepayment fee.</li>

                                <p>Late payment fee - If your payment is more than 20 days late, we may charge a late payment fee to compensate for the delay. The late payment 
                                    fee is 5.00% of your unpaid payment or <?php echo $_SESSION['chapter_details']['currency'] . " "; ?> 50,000, whichever is greater. We charge this fee once for each late payment.</p>

                                <p>Check processing fee - Processing loan payments automatically helps us keep rates low, and there’s no fee for making payments automatically 
                                    by society from your bank account. Handling checks costs more, so we charge a <?php echo $_SESSION['chapter_details']['currency'] . " "; ?>10, 000/= processing fee for each monthly payment made by check. However, 
                                    there is never a fee for paying your loan off early, even if you pay by check.</p>
